# Document manager 

A very simple concept project to demonstrate on a small scale my build, test and deployment abilities 

* bin contains the scripts to build, test and deploy the application

* lambda contains the source code of an AWS lambda function that provides file upload, modify and delete services

* public contains the HTML, CSS and Javascript used to create a user interface 

The user interface can be viewed here:
